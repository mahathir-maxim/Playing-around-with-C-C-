/*
 * The goal of the program is to create a class (the Subject class for this assignment)
 * that has a private variable (address) that can be modified via a standard mutator function (setAddress).
 * This class has additional member functions that allow other classes (the observers)
 *  to register and deregister themselves with the Subject. If observers are registered with the subject,
 *  they will receive notifications (via a callback function) if the subjectâ€™s address ever changes.
